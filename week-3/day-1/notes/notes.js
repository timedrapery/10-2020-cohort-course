/* Objects:
/* We won't get too deep into objects but at an high level, objects are another structured data type that holds properties in key - value pairs, separated by commas. The most common example is a car. It has many properties such as make, model, weight and color. With the topics we've covered, there is no means of associating variables. Objects solves that problem.
/* this COULD possibly work if we were only working with a single car, but most cases, it's not.

/*
var carColor = 'gray';
var carMake = 'Hyundai';
var carModel = 'Elantra';
var carYear = 2009;
var carWeight = 585;
*/

/*
myCar = {
    color: 'gray',
    make: 'Hyundai',
    model: 'Elantra',
    year: 2009,
    weight: 585
}
*/

// Like arrays, you can store different data types within the values of the objects' properties.

// Accessing Values of an Object
// syntax:
/*
objectName.propertyName
*/
// Example:
/*
console.log(myCar.color) // 'gray'
objectName["propertyName"]
*/
// Example:
/*
console.log(myCar['color']) // 'gray'
*/
